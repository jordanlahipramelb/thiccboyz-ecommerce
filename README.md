## Description

**The Fitness Journey** is a web application that allows users to create/log workout routines, learn how to perform a variety of exercises, and ask questions/search topics via forum system.

## Features

The main goal of **Fitness Journey** is to allow an athlete to create workout routines using exercises contained on the website's exercise database. Once created, the athlete is able to log these workouts and share their routines/logs with other users, inspiring them to create their own routines and log workouts for themselves.

**Fitness Journey** contains a database with a variety of exercises. Each exercise contains information: exercise description, equipment utilized, muscles worked, instructions, and a picture showing how to perform the exercise. This allows users to really understand the exercise.

There are many people in the world who like/want to workout; ranging from beginners to advanced. Some of these people know what theyâ€™re doing, but some do not. Users of this application will be able to create an account containing information about what type of fitness they perform, routines they've created, workouts logged, and other basic user information.

Users will be able to share their fitness knowledge with others via post/comment system. This allows users to communicate with other members of the application, as well as grow their knowledge of fitness with one another by sharing information with one another.
